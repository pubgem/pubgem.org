The Pubgem Foundation is dedicated to the aggregation and dissemination of knowledge and wisdom for human benefit.
To achieve this vision, we have undertaken specific open source projects that provide unique services we believe will become critical building blocks in an age of machine-assisted wisdom.
The Pubgem Foundation exists to foster project development by providing material support and resources, and to serve as custodian for any creative byproducts of this effort.
