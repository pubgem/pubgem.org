The new foundation website is launching today.  This marks a distinction between public-facing resources hosted on pubgem.com versus the foundation itself, which is all about coordination, organization, and development.

There are a few technical details that will be relevant for developers.  This website - itself - is hosted on github:

[https://github.com/pubgem/www-pubgem-org](https://github.com/pubgem/www-pubgem-org)

The static files for the project website are also hosted on github:

[https://github.com/pubgem/project-pubgem-org](https://github.com/pubgem/project-pubgem-org)

The source files are currently in another project, although this may be merged at some point in the near future.
